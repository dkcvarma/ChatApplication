A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver pages and other Web 
content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and the content delivery server.

A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more
operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the 
operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly.

A kernel is the central part of an operating system. It manages the operations of the computer and the hardware - most 
notably memory and CPU time. There are two types of kernels: A microkernel, which only contains basic functionality; A 
monolithic kernel, which contains many device drivers.

Device management. To perform useful functions, processes need access to the peripherals connected to the computer, which
 are controlled by the kernel through device drivers. A device driver is a computer program that enables the operating 
 system to interact with a hardware device.
 
The V-model is an SDLC model where execution of processes happens in a sequential manner in a V-shape. It is also 
known as Verification and Validation model. The V-Model is an extension of the waterfall model and is based on the 
association of a testing phase for each corresponding development stage. 

ODBC is procedural and JDBC is object oriented. 2. ODBC is used to provide connection between front-end 
application(other than java) and back-end (database like ms-access) and JDBC is used to provide connection 
between JAVA and database(oracle,sybase,DB2,ms-access).

An interpreter translates high-level instructions into an intermediate form, which it then executes. In contrast, a 
compiler translates high-level instructions directly into machine language. Compiled programs generally run faster 
than interpreted programs. ... This process can be time-consuming if the program is long.
